We present an error tracking mechanism, which uses the available wavelet resources to measure the quality of the wavelet approximations.","author":[{"citationCount":0,"firstName":"Pak","gIndex":0,"hIndex":0,"iD":688636,"lastName":"Wong","middleName":"Chung","publicationCount":0},{"citationCount":0,"firstName":"R.","gIndex":0,"hIndex":0,"iD":247654,"lastName":"Bergeron","middleName":"Daniel","publicationCount":0}],"citationCount":17,"conference":{"citationCount":0,"endYear":0,"fullName":"IEEE Visualization","iD":455,"publicationCount":0,"shortName":"","startYear":0},"dOI":"10.1109/VISUAL.1995.480811","fullVersionURL":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber\u003d480811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber\u003d00480811","http://www.cs.unh.edu/~sdb/wavelet/authenticity.pdf","http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id\u003d832271.833887"],"iD":409908,"keyword":[{"citationCount":0,"iD":9096,"name":"Data Visualization","publicationCount":0},{"citationCount":0,"iD":73921,"name":"Wavelet Transform","publicationCount":0}],"referenceCount":19,"title":"Authenticity Analysis of Wavelet Approximations in Visualization","type":"PAPER","year":1995},"660488":{"Abstract":"Transparency can be a useful device for simultaneously depicting multiple superimposed layers of information in a single image.
